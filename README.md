# Main Read ME file.

Use this prettier file for standardization of look for all code.

Style guides include:
PEP8 for Python
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp for Javascript.

Specific deviations will be noted below:
Use single quotes whenever possible.
Comments are only necessary if you need to make sure you understand something or if it is extremely complex.
Plan for failure BECAUSE!
Follow the Zen of Python as much as possible.
DRY, YAGNI, SOLID should be standards not options.
